# Tensor Operations in Deep Learning

## Overview
Tensors are the fundamental building blocks of deep learning, serving as the primary data structure for neural networks. This repository contains two Colab notebooks that explore various tensor operations in **TensorFlow 2.0** and **PyTorch**, with a focus on **einsum operations** and advanced tensor manipulations. Mastering tensor operations is crucial for excelling in deep learning.

## Repository Structure
This repository includes:
- **TensorFlow Notebook**: Covers basic and advanced tensor operations, including `einsum` applications.
- **PyTorch Notebook**: Demonstrates various tensor operations and their usage in deep learning workflows.
- **Video Walkthrough**: A walkthrough explaining the concepts and code in both notebooks.
